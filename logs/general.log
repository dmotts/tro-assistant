FEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS
Protection: IP66 IK10, NEMA 4 (Independent accredited test laboratory).
Standard: IEC 62208, IEC/EN/AS60529, (UL508A Optional), RoHS.
MATERIAL:
Body: 1.2mm galvanised steel sheet
Gland Plate: 1.5mm galvanised steel sheet
Door: 1.5mm galvanised steel sheet
Device Mounting Plate: 1.5mm galvanised steel sheet
Seal: Polyurethane
ENCLOSURE BODY:
The monoblock body is fabricated using galvanised steel sheet (1.2mm-1.5mm). Flat face sealing surfaces are provided to increase seal life. Pre-fitted blind nutserts are incorporated to accommodate mounts and accessory fasteners to eliminate drilling and retain IP rating. Integral device plate mounts and M6 earth studs are provided. A galvanised steel gland plate is incorporated into the bottom face.
ENCLOSURE DOOR:
The surface mounted door is fabricated using 1.5mm galvanised steel sheet and incorporates concealed removable hinges with captive pins. The door is designed for a 110° opening. Each door contains cable management rails, an M6 earth stud and a high quality machine-applied foamed in place (FIP) Polyurethane seal. Two internal cable management rails can be removed to provide additional space for equipment, duct and door mounted control components.
ENCLOSURE SEAL:
A high quality machine-applied full perimeter UL listed Polyurethane seal foamed in place (FIP) provides excellent sealing over a long life. Temperature resistance -40°C to 80°C (160°C short term loading).
ENCLOSURE LOCK:
Chrome 5mm double bit insert quarter turn lock with key.
DEVICE MOUNTING PLATE:
The device mounting plate is 1.5mm galvanised steel sheet. It is pressed to provide strength. It is pre-fitted into the enclosure as standard.
GLAND PLATE:
Gland plates are incorporated into the bottom face of the enclosure for cable management. They are provided with gaskets and fasteners. The size and quantity vary according to enclosure size.
SURFACE TREATMENT:
